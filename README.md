# CoCa

This project is using both :


[The Glucose SAT solver](http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/ "The Glucose SAT solver")

and

[Arbor.js](https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor "Arbor.js")

All the graphs files are taken from [here.](https://www.labri.fr/perso/dorbec/CoCa/)

---

After compiling the Glucose solver (By going in the *glucose-syrup/simp/* folder and doing *make*) you can launch our code using a simple **./start.sh <graph.c> <nb_of_colors>** command.
